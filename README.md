Game based on Domain Expansion of Hakari Kinji, character from Jujutsu Kaisen, a work by Gege Akutami.\
Hakari's Domain Expansion works following logics from Pachinko Machines and Slots Machines, this game aims to recrate a faithful and imersive representation of Hakari's powers.

# Game Objectives
The main objective is to reach a Jackpot by matching 3 numbers in a Slot-Machine like game.

# Game Mecanics
The game has two buttons, spin and reach, spin will reveal the first two slots' numbers and riichi will show the third one (riichi is a Japanese way to say "reach").\
When a Spin is called, a ball will be launched and its color indicates the probability of reaching a Jackpot as followed:\
Green - 0% to 50%\
Red - 51% to 75%\
Yellow - 76% to 99%\
Purple - 100%\
There're also a Background Images reflecting "scenarios" represented on manga. After calling a failed 'Riichi', there's a chance of rerolling the third number with a low chance of a guaranted Jackpot.
